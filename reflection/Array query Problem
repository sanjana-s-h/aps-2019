Array Querry Problem

1] Look-up table technique-

0 1 2 3 4 
2 5 6 3 8

LookUpTable[][]==> 0 1 2 3 4 index
		   0 0 0 0 0
		   0 1 1 3 3
		   0 0 2 3 3 
		   0 0 0 3 3
		   0 0 0 0 4
In this technique the smallest value until that index is stored.

Space       : n^2
Fetching time : n^2
One step is needed to choose the smallest value between any index.
Advantages  : Search is easy and less time consuming.
Disadvantages: Extra space to store the values of the table.


2]Square root decomposition-

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  main array
3 8 1 5 7 3 6 9 11

0-2 3-5 6-8    SquareRootDecomposition array 
2   5  6

Take another √n array.
In this array considering the main array into groups of √n, the index of the smallest value of group is stored.

Time : n
Access time : √n
Space : √n
Advantage : Time and space both better than look up table technique.
Disadvantage: If the range of the search is in between the √n values like 1-4 then manual/ brute-force technique are to be used.

3]Segment tree-

It is binary tree dividing itself into two parts each time until no further nodes are possible

Time: n
No. of nodes: 2n
Length of tree: log(n)
Advantages:Time consumption better as intermediate searches easily found.
Disadvantages:Space to store all intermediate values.
